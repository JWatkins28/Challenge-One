# Horiseon Code Refactor

## **Description**

This project was the first challenge of our boot camp focused on refactoring a Horiseon webpage to create a more efficient and optimized code. We were asked to review the provided source code and make changes as we see fit to meet the acceptance criteria. 

The deployed app can be accessed here: https://jwatkins28.github.io/Horiseon-Code-Refactor/

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
